## 📦 System Overview

The stack consists of four integrated modules:

- 🔐 CSG — Core AI-XDR engine for adaptive monitoring and incident response  
- 🧠 CG — AI-SOC and threat intelligence layer for correlation and behavioral analysis  
- 🌐 VPN.CSG — Decentralized VPN module for identity protection and secure routing  
- 🔗 Link.CSG — Pre-entry validation gateway for scanning URLs and files before access

Modules communicate via secure APIs and integrate seamlessly with automation tools like [N8N](https://n8n.io).

---

## 🏛️ Architecture Summary

The central unit, Cyber Security Guard, acts as the control core. It connects to CG, VPN.CSG, and Link.CSG in a triangular topology.  
Each module is powered by specialized security bots trained on advanced AI techniques:

- Correlation analysis  
- Behavioral and triage analysis  
- Threat intelligence augmentation  
- Obfuscation and encryption  
- Advanced IP rotation

## ⚙️ Component Breakdown

### 🔐 Cyber Security Guard (CSG)
Internal AI-XDR system  
- 24/7 monitoring at system, file, and process levels  
- AI-trained bots for anomaly detection  
- Proactive vulnerability patching  
- Malware and ransomware detection  
- Micro-segmentation and threat containment

### 🧠 Cyber Guard (CG)
AI-SOC Core  
- Analytical support layer  
- Multi-tier AI for event correlation and threat intelligence  
- Real-time SOC operations  
- Compliance and detection enhancement via machine learning

### 🌐 VPN Guard (VPN.CSG)
Decentralized VPN system  
- Advanced encryption (WireGuard, IPsec)  
- Anonymous identity and smart routing  
- Multi-layered privacy protection  
- Traffic obfuscation and stealth mode

### 🔗 Link Guard (Link.CSG)
Pre-entry validation and encryption platform  
- Quarantine gateway for incoming URLs, files, and images  
- AI-powered deep content and metadata analysis  
- Threat blocking before access  
- External content isolation

---

## 🧰 System Requirements

- Operating System: Linux, Windows Server, or Docker  
- Automation: N8N (recommended via Docker)  
- Modules: CSG, CG, VPN.CSG, Link.CSG  
- Development Environments: Python / Rust / Node.js (per module)

## 🚀 Automation Scenarios with N8N

### 1. Internal Incident Response  
Trigger: CSG detects abnormal behavior or privilege escalation  
Action: Isolate affected device and initiate correlation analysis via CG

### 2. Malicious Link Handling  
Trigger: Incoming link or file passes through N8N  
Action: Forward to Link.CSG for deep scan; block if malicious and report to CSG

### 3. Proactive Vulnerability Patching  
Trigger: CG detects new threat or zero-day vulnerability  
Action: N8N instructs CSG to apply patches across relevant devices
