# System Overview

The Cyber Security Guard Defense Stack consists of four integrated modules designed to deliver adaptive monitoring, proactive defense, and automation efficiency:

- üîí CSG ‚Äî Core AI-XDR engine for real-time detection and incident response  
- üß© CG ‚Äî AI-SOC and threat intelligence for behavioral and correlation analysis  
- üåê VPN.CSG ‚Äî Decentralized VPN for anonymity and secure routing  
- üîó Link.CSG ‚Äî Validation gateway for scanning URLs and files before access

All modules communicate securely via APIs and integrate seamlessly with N8N for workflow automation.

---

# Architecture Summary

The stack forms a triangular defense topology: CSG acts as the control center, linking with CG, VPN.CSG, and Link.CSG.

Capabilities include:

- Behavioral anomaly analysis  
- Threat correlation and augmentation  
- Obfuscation and encryption  
- IP rotation and stealth routing

# Component Breakdown

### Cyber Security Guard (CSG)
- Continuous real-time monitoring  
- AI-based anomaly detection  
- Proactive vulnerability patching  
- Malware and ransomware defense  
- Micro-segmentation and isolation

### Cyber Guard (CG)
- Real-time event correlation  
- Multi-layer AI analytics  
- Threat intelligence enrichment  
- Compliance and detection enhancement

### VPN Guard (VPN.CSG)
- Advanced encryption (WireGuard, IPsec)  
- Anonymous routing and IP rotation  
- Multi-hop secure tunneling  
- Decentralized authentication nodes

### Link Guard (Link.CSG)
- URL and file quarantine scanning  
- Metadata verification  
- Deep AI content analysis  
- Threat isolation before user access

---

# System Requirements

- Operating Systems: Linux (Ubuntu preferred), Windows Server, Docker  
- Automation Engine: N8N (Docker recommended)  
- Programming Environments:
  - Python (CG, Link.CSG)
  - Rust (CSG Core)
  - Node.js (VPN.CSG, N8N)

# Automation Scenarios (via N8N)

### Scenario 1 ‚Äî Internal Incident Response
Trigger: CSG detects abnormal system behavior  
Action: Isolate endpoint ‚Üí Correlate via CG ‚Üí Report via N8N

### Scenario 2 ‚Äî Malicious Link Interception
Trigger: URL or file passes through gateway  
Action: Link.CSG scans ‚Üí Block if malicious ‚Üí Notify CSG

### Scenario 3 ‚Äî Zero-Day Patch Deployment
Trigger: CG identifies new global threat  
Action: N8N coordinates patch rollout through CSG
