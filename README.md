üõ°Ô∏è Cyber Security Guard Defense Stack

Multi-layered adaptive cybersecurity framework integrating AI-driven threat detection, real-time monitoring, VPN anonymity, and pre-entry link validation. Designed for ethical, defensive use with automated workflows and SOAR logic.

‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The Cyber Security Guard Stack is a comprehensive defensive ecosystem designed for maximum resilience. It combines multiple modules:

CSG (Core AI-XDR): Central intelligence and adaptive monitoring

CG (AI-SOC & Threat Intel): Threat correlation and analytical support

VPN.CSG: Secure, decentralized anonymity and routing

Link.CSG: Pre-entry AI-based link validation

This framework allows seamless automation and coordination between modules via secure APIs and workflow orchestration (e.g., N8N).
Visual overview of the workflow is provided below:




üß© Architectural Components
Component	Technical Role	Position in Stack
CSG	AI-XDR Core	Central/Internal
CG	AI-SOC & Threat Intel	Supportive/Analytical
VPN.CSG	Decentralized Anonymity	Perimeter/Boundary
Link.CSG	Pre-Entry AI Validation	Perimeter/Gateway
üß∞ Prerequisites

OS: Linux/Windows Server or Containerized Environment

Automation: N8N installed (Docker recommended)

Dependencies: Install or build all four modules (CSG, CG, VPN.CSG, Link.CSG)

Development Environments: Python / Rust / Node.js depending on module

üöÄ Deployment & N8N Integration
Step 1: Install Modules

Follow the instructions for each component to deploy them in your environment. Ensure APIs are enabled and reachable.

Step 2: Configure N8N for Automation
Scenario 1: Internal Incident Response

Trigger: N8N receives alert from CSG on anomaly detection or privilege escalation

Action: Isolate the affected host (CSG) and run threat correlation (CG)

Scenario 2: Pre-entry Malicious Link Handling

Trigger: Any inbound link/file passes through N8N first

Action: Send link to Link.CSG for deep inspection. Block if malicious and notify CSG

Scenario 3: Proactive Vulnerability Updates

Trigger: CG generates alert on newly discovered Threat Intelligence (Zero-Day)

Action: N8N instructs CSG to initiate automated vulnerability patching
