# 🛡️ Cyber Security Guard Defense Stack

> 🌍 Available Languages: [English](README.md) | [العربية](README.ar.md)

A multi-layered cybersecurity ecosystem integrating AI-driven threat detection, decentralized VPN anonymity, and intelligent link validation.  
Designed for **ethical security research** and **defensive operations**, fully automated through **SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation & Response).

## 🧰 System Overview

The defense stack is composed of **four integrated modules**, each serving a critical security function:

- 🔐 **CSG** — Core AI-XDR engine for adaptive monitoring and incident response  
- 🧠 **CG** — AI-SOC & Threat Intelligence layer for behavior-based correlation  
- 🌐 **VPN.CSG** — Decentralized VPN network for anonymity and secure routing  
- 🔗 **Link.CSG** — Pre-entry validation system for scanning links and files before access  

All modules communicate securely via APIs and can be automated using [N8N](https://n8n.io).

---

## 🏛️ Architecture Summary

The **Cyber Security Guard (CSG)** acts as the central command node.  
It connects to **CG**, **VPN.CSG**, and **Link.CSG** forming a secure triangular mesh.  
Each node operates autonomously yet shares intelligence in real time.

🧩 Core capabilities include:
- Correlation & anomaly analysis  
- Behavioral profiling & triage  
- AI-driven threat prediction  
- Advanced encryption & obfuscation  
- Rotating IP topology for stealth operations

## ⚙️ Component Breakdown

### 🔐 Cyber Security Guard (CSG)
AI-XDR (Extended Detection & Response) Core  
- Continuous monitoring across files, processes, and network layers  
- Machine learning–based anomaly detection  
- Automated containment and patch deployment  
- Malware & ransomware defense  
- Real-time micro-segmentation  

### 🧠 Cyber Guard (CG)
AI-SOC and Threat Intelligence Hub  
- Correlates incidents across distributed systems  
- ML-powered threat scoring  
- Real-time alerting and automated triage  
- SOC dashboard integration for analytics and compliance  

### 🌐 VPN Guard (VPN.CSG)
Decentralized VPN & Privacy System  
- Uses WireGuard / IPsec for encryption  
- Onion-style routing with smart path switching  
- Obfuscation and stealth traffic modes  
- Distributed trustless identity  

### 🔗 Link Guard (Link.CSG)
Pre-entry Validation & Content Isolation  
- Scans incoming URLs, files, and documents  
- Deep AI content inspection with hash reputation lookup  
- Sandbox execution for zero-day isolation  
- Blocks malicious payloads pre-access  

---

## 🧩 System Requirements

- 🖥️ Operating System: Linux, Windows Server, or Docker  
- ⚙️ Automation: N8N (Docker recommended)  
- 🧰 Languages & Frameworks:  
  - Python — CG / Link.CSG  
  - Rust — CSG Core  
  - Node.js — VPN.CSG / N8N  

---

## 🚀 Automation Scenarios via N8N

### ⚡ 1. Automated Incident Response
**Trigger:** CSG detects privilege escalation  
**Action:** N8N isolates affected endpoint and instructs CG to perform correlation analysis.

### 🕵️ 2. Malicious Link Detection
**Trigger:** New link or file uploaded to system  
**Action:** Sent to Link.CSG → if malicious, blocked and reported to CSG.

### 🔧 3. Proactive Patch Deployment
**Trigger:** CG identifies new vulnerability signature  
**Action:** N8N instructs CSG to deploy relevant patches and confirm closure.
