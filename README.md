# 🛡️ Cyber Security Guard Defense Stack

Multi-layered adaptive cybersecurity framework integrating AI-driven threat detection, real-time monitoring, VPN anonymity, and pre-entry link validation. Designed for ethical, defensive use with automated workflows and SOAR logic.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

The Cyber Security Guard Stack is a comprehensive defensive ecosystem designed for maximum resilience. It combines multiple modules:

- **CSG (Core AI-XDR)**: Central intelligence and adaptive monitoring
- **CG (AI-SOC & Threat Intel)**: Threat correlation and analysis
- **VPN.CSG**: Secure, decentralized anonymity and routing
- **Link.CSG**: Pre-entry AI-based link validation

This framework allows seamless automation and coordination between modules via secure APIs and workflow orchestration (e.g., N8N).

## 🧩 Architectural Components

| Component | Technical Role | Position in Stack |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| CSG       | AI-XDR Core    | Central/Internal |
| CG        | AI-SOC & Threat Intel | Supportive/Analytical |
| VPN.CSG   | Decentralized Anonymity | Perimeter/Boundary |
| Link.CSG  | Pre-Entry AI Validation | Perimeter/Gateway |

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- **OS**: Linux/Windows Server or Containerized Environment  
- **Automation**: N8N installed (Docker recommended)  
- **Dependencies**: Install or build all four modules (CSG, CG, VPN.CSG, Link.CSG)  
- **Python/Rust/Node environments** depending on each module requirements  

---

## 🚀 Deployment & N8N Integration

### Step 1: Install Modules
Follow the instructions for each component to deploy them in your environment. Ensure APIs are enabled and reachable.

### Step 2: Configure N8N for Automation

#### Scenario 1: Internal Incident Response
- **Trigger**: N8N receives alert from CSG on anomaly detection or privilege escalation.  
- **Action**: Isolate the affected host (CSG) and run threat correlation (CG).  

#### Scenario 2: Pre-entry Malicious Link Handling
- **Trigger**: Any inbound link/file passes through N8N first.  
- **Action**: Send link to Link.CSG for analysis. Block if malicious and notify CSG.
