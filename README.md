🔐 System Overview

The Cyber Security Guard Defense Stack consists of four integrated modules designed to deliver adaptive monitoring, proactive defense, and automation efficiency.

🔒 CSG — Core AI-XDR engine for real-time detection and incident response

🧩 CG — AI-SOC and threat intelligence for behavioral and correlation analysis

🌐 VPN.CSG — Decentralized VPN for anonymity and secure routing

🔗 Link.CSG — Validation gateway for scanning URLs and files before access

All modules communicate securely via APIs and integrate seamlessly with N8N
 for workflow automation.

🏛️ Architecture Summary

The stack forms a triangular defense topology:
CSG acts as the control center, linking with CG, VPN.CSG, and Link.CSG.

Each module contributes specialized AI-driven capabilities, including:

Behavioral anomaly analysis

Threat correlation and augmentation

Obfuscation and encryption

IP rotation and stealth routing

⚙️ Component Breakdown
🔒 Cyber Security Guard (CSG)

Continuous real-time monitoring

AI-based anomaly detection

Proactive vulnerability patching

Malware and ransomware defense

Micro-segmentation and isolation

🧠 Cyber Guard (CG)

Real-time event correlation

Multi-layer AI analytics

Threat intelligence enrichment

Compliance and detection enhancement

🌐 VPN Guard (VPN.CSG)

Advanced encryption (WireGuard, IPsec)

Anonymous routing and IP rotation

Multi-hop secure tunneling

Decentralized authentication nodes

🔗 Link Guard (Link.CSG)

URL and file quarantine scanning

Metadata verification

Deep AI content analysis

Threat isolation before user access

🧰 System Requirements

Operating Systems: Linux (Ubuntu preferred), Windows Server, Docker
Automation Engine: N8N (Docker recommended)
Programming Environments:

Python (CG, Link.CSG)

Rust (CSG Core)

Node.js (VPN.CSG, N8N)

🚀 Automation Scenarios (via N8N)
Scenario 1 – Internal Incident Response

Trigger: CSG detects abnormal system behavior
Action: Isolate endpoint → Correlate via CG → Report via N8N

Scenario 2 – Malicious Link Interception

Trigger: URL or file passes through gateway
Action: Link.CSG scans → Block if malicious → Notify CSG

Scenario 3 – Zero-Day Patch Deployment

Trigger: CG identifies new global threat
Action: N8N coordinates patch rollout through CSG
