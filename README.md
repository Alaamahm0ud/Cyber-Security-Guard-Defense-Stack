## 🔐 System Overview

The Cyber Security Guard Defense Stack consists of four integrated modules designed to deliver adaptive monitoring, proactive defense, and automation efficiency:

- 🔒 **CSG** — Core AI-XDR engine for real-time detection and incident response  
- 🧩 **CG** — AI-SOC and threat intelligence for behavioral and correlation analysis  
- 🌐 **VPN.CSG** — Decentralized VPN for anonymity and secure routing  
- 🔗 **Link.CSG** — Validation gateway for scanning URLs and files before access

All modules communicate securely via APIs and integrate seamlessly with [N8N](https://n8n.io) for workflow automation.

---

## 🏛️ Architecture Summary

The stack forms a triangular defense topology:  
CSG acts as the control center, linking with CG, VPN.CSG, and Link.CSG.

Each module contributes specialized AI-driven capabilities, including:

- 🧠 Behavioral anomaly analysis  
- 🔗 Threat correlation and augmentation  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Obfuscation and encryption  
- 🌍 IP rotation and stealth routing

## ⚙️ Component Breakdown

### 🔒 Cyber Security Guard (CSG)

- Continuous real-time monitoring  
- AI-based anomaly detection  
- Proactive vulnerability patching  
- Malware and ransomware defense  
- Micro-segmentation and isolation

### 🧠 Cyber Guard (CG)

- Real-time event correlation  
- Multi-layer AI analytics  
- Threat intelligence enrichment  
- Compliance and detection enhancement

### 🌐 VPN Guard (VPN.CSG)

- Advanced encryption (WireGuard, IPsec)  
- Anonymous routing and IP rotation  
- Multi-hop secure tunneling  
- Decentralized authentication nodes

### 🔗 Link Guard (Link.CSG)

- URL and file quarantine scanning  
- Metadata verification  
- Deep AI content analysis  
- Threat isolation before user access

---

## 🧰 System Requirements

- 🖥️ Operating Systems: Linux (Ubuntu preferred), Windows Server, Docker  
- ⚙️ Automation Engine: N8N (Docker recommended)  
- 💻 Programming Environments:  
  - Python (CG, Link.CSG)  
  - Rust (CSG Core)  
  - Node.js (VPN.CSG, N8N)

---

## 🚀 Automation Scenarios (via N8N)

### 🧠 Scenario 1 – Internal Incident Response  
Trigger: CSG detects abnormal system behavior  
Action: Isolate endpoint → Correlate via CG → Report via N8N

### 🔗 Scenario 2 – Malicious Link Interception  
Trigger: URL or file passes through gateway  
Action: Link.CSG scans → Block if malicious → Notify CSG

### 🛡️ Scenario 3 – Zero-Day Patch Deployment  
Trigger: CG identifies new global threat  
Action: N8N coordinates patch rollout through CSG
