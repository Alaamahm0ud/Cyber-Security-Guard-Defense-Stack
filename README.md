🔐 System Overview

The Cyber Security Guard Defense Stack is composed of four tightly integrated modules, designed to provide adaptive monitoring, proactive defense, and seamless automation.

🔒 CSG — Core AI-XDR engine for adaptive monitoring and incident response

🧩 CG — AI-SOC and threat intelligence module for event correlation

🌐 VPN.CSG — Decentralized VPN layer for privacy and secure routing

🔗 Link.CSG — Pre-entry validation gateway for URL and file scanning

All modules communicate securely through APIs and can be automated via N8N
.

🏛️ Architecture Summary

The stack follows a triangular security topology, with CSG at the center orchestrating intelligence between CG, VPN.CSG, and Link.CSG.

Each module operates independently but contributes to a unified defense grid powered by AI models trained for:

Behavioral anomaly detection

Threat intelligence enhancement

Obfuscation and encryption

IP rotation and stealth routing

⚙️ Component Breakdown
🔒 Cyber Security Guard (CSG)

AI-XDR core responsible for adaptive protection and system-level detection.

Continuous real-time monitoring

Automated patching and response

Malware and ransomware detection

Micro-segmentation and isolation

🧠 Cyber Guard (CG)

AI-SOC and correlation engine.

Real-time event analysis

Threat correlation and enrichment

Machine learning–driven detection models

Compliance and alert automation

🌐 VPN Guard (VPN.CSG)

Privacy-focused decentralized VPN.

WireGuard/IPsec encryption

Intelligent IP rotation

Multi-hop routing and stealth mode

Decentralized node authentication

🔗 Link Guard (Link.CSG)

Pre-entry validation layer for secure access.

URL and file quarantine gateway

Metadata and hash verification

Deep AI-powered scanning

Threat blocking before access

🧰 System Requirements

Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu preferred), Windows Server, or Docker environment

Automation Engine: N8N (Docker recommended)

Languages & Frameworks:

Python (CG, Link.CSG)

Rust (CSG Core)

Node.js (VPN.CSG, N8N)

🚀 Automation Scenarios (via N8N)
Scenario 1 — Internal Incident Response

Trigger: CSG detects system anomaly
Action: Isolate endpoint → CG correlates threat → Notify admin via N8N

Scenario 2 — Malicious Link Interception

Trigger: User request passes through gateway
Action: Link.CSG scans URL → If malicious → Block + report to CSG

Scenario 3 — Zero-Day Vulnerability Defense

Trigger: CG detects new global threat
Action: N8N instructs CSG to auto-patch affected environments
